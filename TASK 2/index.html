                <p>A man who “boarded an autorickshaw from Jamia Nagar Metro station” and “couldn’t speak Hindi properly” is learnt to be a suspect in connection with Tuesday’s low-intensity blast near the Israel Embassy in the national capital. While he remains elusive, police are — 72 hours later — yet to file an FIR in connection with the incident, which Israel has called a “possible terror attack”, prompting it to issue a travel advisory to its citizens.</p>
                <p>The hunt for the accused had initially led police to as many as 12 people. “After scanning footage from CCTVs in the area, police found that a dozen people had visited the crime scene in the hours leading up to the blast, and efforts began to try and trace all of them,” said a police source.</p>
                <p>“This included civil department labourers who were working at the spot, a porter, and a couple, all of whom were questioned and eventually given a clean chit. Police then zeroed in on a man seen coming out of an autorickshaw around 2.30 pm,” said the source.</p>

                <p>Maine’s top election official on Thursday disqualified Donald Trump from the state ballot in next year’s US presidential primary election, according to Reuters reports. With this, it has become the second state to bar the former president for his role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.</p>
                <p>Shenna Bellows, Maine Secretary of State who is a Democrat concluded that the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2024 incited an insurrection when he spread false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election and then urged his supporters to march on the Capitol to stop lawmakers from certifying the vote.</p>

                <h5><u>Infosys, LIC, JSW Steel, SBI shares: These 2023 largecap laggards may deliver big in 2024</u></h5>
                <img src="img/Business.jpg" alt="business" width="400" height="400" class="center">
                <p>A few largecap stocks, which failed to outshine Nifty50 in 2023 so far, may deliver healthy returns in 2024, said a few brokerages. Infosys Ltd, State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank Ltd, Divis Laboratories Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd, Life Insurance Corporation of India and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are a few stocks that look set to bounce back in the coming year, a few brokerages suggested based on fundamental or technical considerations</p>
                <p>Against a Sensex rise of 18.15 per cent in 2023, Infosys delivered a mere 1.25 per cent return; SBI gained 4.69 per cent, HDFC Bank 5.10 per cent, RIL 9.2 per cent, JSW Steel 12.87 per cent, Divis Laboratories 16.20 per cent and LIC 17 per cent during the same period.</p>

                <p>Tanvi Kanchan, Head - Corporate Strategy at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers said there is a strong case for three stocks that did not rise much in 2023 and which could potentially recover significantly by 2024.</p>
                    
                <p>"My primary choice is the SBI, which, despite an exceptionally robust year in terms of earnings, has maintained a flat stock performance. Positioned as a proxy for India's growth narrative and currently trading below the price-to-book value of 2, SBI stands as an intriguing investment opportunity. I set a conservative target of Rs. 800 for SBI in 2024, reflecting an approximate 25 per cent increase from its present levels. Divis Laboratories, which lagged behind both the Nifty and Nifty Pharma indexes is my second pick. Anticipating continued strength in the pharmaceutical sector due to favorable valuations and relatively low ownership, coupled with an optimistic view on overcoming margin challenges and US pricing pressure, I project a target of Rs 5,000 for Divis Labs," Kanchan said.</p>

                <h5><u>Salaar box office collection day 7: Prabhas-starrer witnesses 85% drop in collections after first week, crosses Rs 500 crore</u></h5>
                <img src="img/Entertainment.jpg" alt="entertainment" width="400" height="400" class="center">
                <p>The Prabhas-starrer Salaar, which was released in the theatres on December 22, started its box office journey by making Rs 90.7 crore on day one. But in just a week’s time, the collections of the film have dipped by over 85%. On Thursday, which was Salaar’s seventh day in theatres, the film only managed to make Rs 13.5 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk. This takes the film’s nett domestic collection to Rs 308.9 crore.</p>

                <p>On Thursday, the film witnessed 21% occupancy in Telugu markets, which is the primary market for the film’s lead star, Prabhas. In Hyderabad, Salaar had 638 shows with an occupancy of 24.75%. In the Hindi-speaking market, where Salaar is competing against Shah Rukh Khan’s Dunki, the film saw an occupancy of 20.52%. Salaar had 637 shows in the Delhi-NCR region and 441 shows in the Mumbai region, and they witnessed an occupancy of 23.75% and 18.25%, respectively.</p>
                <p>The film passed the Rs 500 crore gross mark worldwide on Thursday, making it the seventh film of the year to pass the milestone, after releases like Pathaan, Jawan, Jailer, Leo, Gadar 2 and Animal. Salaar made Rs 175 crore globally on the first day itself, which means that it collected a total of Rs 325 crore through the rest of the week. Salaar marks a big comeback for its lead actor Prabhas who hasn’t had a big hit at the theatres since 2017’s Baahubali 2. He’d previously starred in the big-budget bombs Saaho, Radhe Shyam and Adipurush. He’ll soon be seen in Kalki 2898 AD, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and others.</p>
